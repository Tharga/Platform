/// <summary>
/// Computes the team-membership/consent claims for a caller in a given team: team key, the
/// <see cref="Roles.TeamMember"/> and <c>Team{AccessLevel}</c> roles, access level, member key, and the
/// effective team scopes. Shared by <see cref="TeamServerClaimsTransformation"/> (initial HTTP
/// enrichment) and <see cref="TeamClaimRevalidator"/> (periodic in-circuit revalidation) so the two
/// server paths cannot drift.
/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// Returns only the team-derived claims — not the team-independent system scopes (those come from the
/// caller's app roles and are added separately by the transformation). Returns an empty list when the
/// caller has no membership and no consent access to the team.
