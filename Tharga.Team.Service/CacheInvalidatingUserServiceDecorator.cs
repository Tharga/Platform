/// Decorator over <see cref="IUserService"/> that drops the cached copy of a user after any call that

/// </summary>
/// <remarks>
/// <c>UserServiceBase</c> caches resolved users and invalidates in the paths it owns. A host overriding
/// one of those to supply persistence <i>replaces</i> the path that invalidates, so the write commits
/// and every later read is served stale. That is the toolkit dropping a responsibility it owns, not a
/// host concern, so the fix belongs here rather than in a note telling every host to remember.
/// <para>
/// <b>Why a decorator and not a template method.</b> The obvious fix is to make the mutating members
/// non-virtual and have them call a <c>protected abstract</c> hook, which would make it impossible to
/// get wrong. That is a <b>breaking change</b> — it stops every existing override compiling — so it is
/// 4.0 work. A decorator invalidates regardless of who implemented the member, needs no consumer
/// change, and can ship in a minor.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// <b><see cref="IUserService.SetUserLastSeenAsync"/> is deliberately not invalidated.</b> It runs on
/// every authenticated resolve (throttled), so invalidating there would empty the cache continuously
/// and defeat the thing this class exists to keep correct. A cached <see cref="IUser.LastSeen"/> is
/// therefore up to one resolve stale, which is the behaviour that already shipped.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Invalidation runs only after the inner call returns. A throwing write has changed nothing, and
/// dropping a valid entry because a write failed would trade a stale read for a needless one.
