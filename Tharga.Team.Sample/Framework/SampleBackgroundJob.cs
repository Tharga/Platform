/// Without the scope this job's entries would be attributed to <see cref="AuditCallerType.Unknown"/>,

/// <para>
/// Takes <see cref="CompositeAuditLogger"/>, not <c>IAuditLogger</c>. The composite applies the caller
/// and event filters and fans out to every configured backend; <c>IAuditLogger</c> resolves to whichever
/// single backend was registered last, so an entry sent there reaches one store and skips the filters.
